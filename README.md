# Word-Guess-Game

My version of the "Hangman" game. This is an arcade style version inspired by late 80's and 90's video games.
In this game you need to guess the name of the retro video game using one letter at a time.

## Retro games are awesome

Yes, they are!

## What I used

This game was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap 4 & CSS3.
