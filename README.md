# Word-Guess-Game
My version of the "Hangman" game. This is an arcade style version inspired by the late 80's and 90's video games.<br>
In this game you need to guess the name of the retro video game using one letter at a time.

## Retro games are awesome!
Yes, they are! <br>

## What i used:
This game was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap 4 & CSS3.
